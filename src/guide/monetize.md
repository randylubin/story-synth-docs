# Monetization

Story Synth is in the process of adding new monetization functionality.

Currently you can add a web monetization wallet so that users of [Coil](https://coil.com/) will send a stream of micropayments to you as they play.

## Getting a Wallet

To set up this feature, first you need to get a wallet, to receive the payments. I use [Uphold](https://uphold.com/), which is free and easy to use.

## Setting up Web Monetization for your game

The option 'wallet' sets your wallet address and the addional option 'revShare' sets the percentage that gets shared with Story Synth. If you leave out 'revShare' it will default to 20% shared with Story Synth. In the example below, 0.2 is translated as 20%.

| First Column | Extension Name | Example Customization         |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| option       | wallet         | \$ilp.uphold.com/WMbkRBiZFgbx |
| option       | revShare       | 0.2                           |

## Coming soon

I'm currently exploring new features tied to monetization. Currently under consideration are:

- Putting your content behind a web monetization paywall
- Putting part of your game behind a paywall (e.g. the inital part is available as a demo but the full game is paid)
- Having some features behind a paywall (e.g. fancy visual styling is only for paying groups)

If you have thoughts on what monetization features you want to see, I'd love to hear them!
