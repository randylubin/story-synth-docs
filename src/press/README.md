### The easiest way to design tabletop storytelling games

Story Synth is a free platform for designing, playing, and sharing storytelling tabletop games online. Designing is super easy – just add prompts to a Google Spreadsheet, drop the sheet link in the web site, and then Story Synth automatically generates the game with a custom homepage. Watch the above [video tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqfBcB4iZEI) to see it in action.

### Browser-based multiplayer storytelling

From the game's homepage, you can create new sessions with unique URLs and every player on that page will see the same storytelling prompts at the same time. Story Synth works well on both desktop and mobile browsers. It's great for simple, prompt driven games like For the Queen or The Quiet Year.

### Flexible customization for different types of games

Story Synth supports a variety of formats that involve different ways of organizing, shuffling, or building the storytelling prompts. There are also a variety of custom options and extensions that let designers restyle the visual design, add a dice roller, include simple state tracking, and much more.

### Dozens of games created so far
